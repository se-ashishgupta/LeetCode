## Structure

Each topic folder contains:

- `README.md` - Contains all problems related to that topic, with explanations and solutions
- Solution files (e.g., `.cpp`, `.java`, `.py`) for implementations
- In (number) shows leetcode problem number
- Additional resources or notes if applicable

## How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to a topic you're interested in
2. Select a specific problem to view its details
3. Study the solution approaches and implementations
4. Try solving the problem yourself before checking the solution

## Contributing
